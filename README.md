# Telefocus

Telefocus is an experimental app to help me learn about communicating Bluetooth hardware
on iOS.The app communicates with an Arduino that rotates a servo depending on the angle
selected from a slider. The servo controls a needle on my "focus" meter to let others
know how much focus I require....at a distance!

It's just for fun.
